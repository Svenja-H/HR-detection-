Data sets recorded and used for my bachelor's thesis on contactless hear rate detection via webcam using remote photoplethysmography. 

Data has been recorded under two conditions: 

- Resting Mode: participant sits calmly in front of webcam without being exposed to physical exertion immediately before the recording

- Exercise Mode: participant performs 2 minute exercising immediately before the recording, but again sits calmly in front of webcam
